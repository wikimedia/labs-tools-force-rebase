# ForceRebase

This tool is used to "force" a rebase to go through, without resolving any conflict (and thus
leaving conflict markers behind) so that the resolution of conflicts can be done in gerrit's
online editor instead of needing to check out the change locally.

The tool is available at https://force-rebase.toolforge.org/ but is still a work-in-progress.
